			<p>COBOL is a high-level language. One must understand the way COBOL works. Computers only understand machine code, a binary stream of 0s and 1s.</p>
			<p>COBOL code must be converted into machine code using a compiler.</p>
			<p>Run the program source through a compiler. The compiler first checks for any syntax errors and then converts it into machine language.</p> 
			<p>The compiler creates an output file which is known as load module. This output file contains executable code in the form of 0s and 1s.</p>

				Evolution 
			</header>
			<ul>
				<li>During 1950s, when the businesses were growing in the western part of the world, there was a need to automate various processes for ease of operation and this gave birth to a high-level programming language meant for business data processing.</li>
				<li>In 1959, COBOL was developed by CODASYL (Conference on Data Systems Language).</li>
				<li>The next version, COBOL-61, was released in 1961 with some revisions.</li>
				<li>In 1968, COBOL was approved by ANSI as a standard language for commercial use (COBOL-68).</li>
				<li>It was again revised in 1974 and 1985 to develop subsequent versions named COBOL-74 and COBOL-85 respectively.</li>
				<li>In 2002, Object-Oriented COBOL was released, which could use encapsulated objects as a normal part of COBOL programming.</li>

				Importance
			</header>
			<ul>
				<li>COBOL was the first widely used high-level programming language. It is an English-like language which is user friendly. All the instructions can be coded in simple English words.</li>
				<li>COBOL is also used as a self-documenting language.</li>
				<li>COBOL can handle huge data processing.</li>
				<li>COBOL is compatible with its previous versions.</li>
				<li>COBOL has effective error messages and so, resolution of bugs is easier.</li>

			<p>Standard Language</p>
			<p>COBOL is a standard language that can be compiled and executed on machines such as IBM AS/400, personal computers, etc</p>
			<p>Business Oriented</p>
			<p>COBOL was designed for business-oriented applications related to financial domain, defense domain, etc. It can handle huge volumes of data because of its advanced file handling capabilities.</p>
			<p>Robust Language</p>
			<p>COBOL is a robust language as its numerous debugging and testing tools are available for almost all computer platforms.</p>
			<p>Structured Language</p>
			<p>Logical control structures are available in COBOL which makes it easier to read and modify. COBOL has different divisions, so it is easy to debug.</p>
